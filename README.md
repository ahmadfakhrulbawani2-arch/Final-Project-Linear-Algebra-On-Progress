## About This Project
so first of all what the heck is this project? So this is a program to run some mathematical operation taught in my 1st semester of linear algebra class. </br>

Spesifically I'm building a matrix oepration calculator program such as determinant, inverse, and its implementation such as linear equation. </br>

Math theory used is: </br>
1. 2x2 matrix determinant (I'm using NumPy for this)
2. Gauss-Jordan elimination and Elementary Row Operation (ERO) for linear equation and determinant of 3x3 or higher matrix. 
3. Inverse of a matrix using Gauss-Jordan and ERO.
4. Basic Minor and Cofactor of a matrix. </br>

All of this program was created using Python3 v3.12.0 and accumulated into a single Jupyter Notebook file. Also not forget about NumPy as my beloved library

## Repository Structure
```txt
|
|-- Code/
|   |
|   |-- detKofaktor.py
|   |
|   |-- obeDet.py
|   |
|   |-- obeSpl.py
|   |
|   |-- obeInvers.pyV
|
|-- all-in-one.ipynb
|
|-- .gitignore

```
*Note: Files in Code/ are actually written in indonesian. Only Jupyter Notebook is written in English.

## How to run the program?
What you need is a python launcher. Here I'm using Python3 v3.12.0. You can use any version of Python so don't worry. </br>
You can download python launcher here: https://www.python.org/
</br>

Next, let's setup the program: </br>
1. Clone / download this GitHub repository into your device.
2. Open command prompt or terminal and head to your repository:
```bash
cd _Your_directory_location
```
3. At the directory, make a virtual environment (venv):

```bash
python -m venv .venv

venv\Scripts\activate
```
*note: You can use / instead of \ if it doesn't work. Make sure you get this message:
```bash
(venv) C:\Your_directory_location>
```
4. Open the all-in-one.ipynb file or the Jupyter file and try to run all of them. You may or may not get the message to install some packages, if so, do it according the message.
5. If you have done run the entire files without any error, congratulations you can use the programs now.
6. To run python program, open command prompt or terminals and head to the file folder and write:
```bash
python detKofaktor.py
```
for example. The result should be similar to Jupyter Notebook.
